# Array Data Engine

This repo is a python package for managing array data. It facilitates storing and accessing large amounts of array data, and also provides a generator for many types of data (unlike PyTorch).

## Features

 - Numpy symantics to data
 - Scales beyond memory limits
 - Generators for more data types
 - and more...

 ## Installation

```bash
python3 setup.py install
```

## Usage

(coming soon)

## Documentation and Examples

See notebooks for examples

## Why?

Developing intelligent systems often designing algorithms that depend on correlations between heterogeneous and over long context windows. This project is an attempt to address that with a convenient interface.
